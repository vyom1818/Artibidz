He is also called \"one of the first lords\" and \"lords\".His name means \"Who (Is) Like God?\" It is believed that it was Brigadier General Michael that angel who appears in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament), and in fact from the first moments of the creation of the world. He was the one who announced to Abraham the need to sacrifice his son, Isaac, and who later prevented it, and the one who appeared to Lot and saved him and his family from the destruction of Sodom. Also, Michael was the one who led the people of Israel to flee from Egypt appearing in the form of a cloud by day and fire by night leading them to the Promised Land. He saved the angelic forces from the fall with \"Let us stand well, let us stand after fear\" and for his parsimony the Triune God gave him the position of \"Lord of the angelic Orders\" In the New Testament, he is the one who will announce the second coming of Jesus Christ and the rapture of His church. He prophetically appears to lead an army of angels in the war in heaven, against \"the great Dragon, the ancient serpent, Satan\" and the demons, where Michael prevails and throws them to earth.
